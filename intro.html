  <h1 id="mainHD" align="center">Motivation</h1>  </br>
  <p> After a false-start in the 1980s, it's finally time for VR to shine. Facebook
	famously bought Oculus for 2 billion dollars in 2014, and now several major
	headsets are on the market (Oculus Rift, Sony's PlayStation VR, HTC Vive
	and more). Our motivation is the boom of this VR technology in the current era
	and how its storming the market leading us to a whole new world. Major game
	engines such as Unity and Unreal are now supporting VR, and the computer
	power required to drive VR is finally affordable. Today we have some great
	platforms to work with including Oculus Rift, Google Project Cardboard, and
	Samsung Gear VR.</p>

	<p> Survival VR is a survival horror video game played from a first-person
	perspective. The player will encounter a number of creatures, which will
	each embody an aspect of the gameâ€™s themes. Survival primarily utilizes
	elements of psychological horror instead of conventional scares found in
	most video games within the genre. Throughout the game, the player will
	find a large array of clues, such as notes and audio tapes, which builds
	atmosphere and furthers the plot. Similar to most titles by Frictional
	Games, there is no combat, and instead the player progresses through
	puzzle-solving, exploration and the use of stealth. </p>
